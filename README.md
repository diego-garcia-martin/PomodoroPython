# PomodoroPython
Simple Pomodoro timer with Python and Tkinter

The code can be way cleaner and structured, and the UI is not the best, but it is fine for a one day project with some usability.
The Timer counts periods of work and rest so you can be more productive, default is 25 minutes of work and 5 of rest, with a 15 minutes rest time every 3 cycles.
All these parameters can be changed.
